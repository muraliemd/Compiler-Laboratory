# Compiler-Laboratory
CS6612 - Compiler Laboratory. As per Anna university syllabus experiment will upload one by one.

SYllabus
1.Implementation of Symbol Table
2. Develop a lexical analyzer to recognize a few patterns in C.
(Ex. identifiers, constants, comments, operators etc.)
3. Implementation of Lexical Analyzer using Lex Tool
4. Generate YACC specification for a few syntactic categories.
a) Program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that usesoperator +, - , * and /.
b) Program to recognize a valid variable which starts with a letterfollowed by any
number of letters or digits.
d)Implementation of Calculator using LEX and YACC
5. Convert the BNF rules into Yacc form and write code to generate Abstract Syntax Tree.
6. Implement type checking
7. Implement control flow analysis and Data flow Analysis
8. Implement any one storage allocation strategies(Heap,Stack,Static)
9. Construction of DAG
10. Implement the back end of the compiler which takes the three address code and produces the
8086 assembly language instructions that can be assembled and run using a 8086 assembler.
The target assembly instructions can be simple move, add, sub, jump. Also simple addressing
modes are used.
11. Implementation of Simple Code Optimization Techniques (Constant Folding., etc.)
